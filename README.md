# Binary-to-Decimal-Converter-with-GUI-
In this homework, you are asked to develop a simple Binary-to-Decimal Converter. This converter lets the user write a binary string (using only 0s and 1s) using the keyboard or a button for each number. It then allows him or her to convert the resulting binary string to a decimal number and then add it to a List Box.
